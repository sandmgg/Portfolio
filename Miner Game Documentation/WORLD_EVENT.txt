1) A mouse click must be used to trigger the event. 
It is legal on any space within the grid.
2) If any entity is in the square that was clicked it will be removed. 
Once the event is triggered, elmo should spawn. 
In addition, ice should spawn at the location at which the mouse click occured
and at the 8 squares adjacent to that square as long as they are in the grid. 
Only miners will be affected by the ice because ore blobs are immune to the cold.
Miners will only be affected in they are on the tiles when the ice spawns because
the ice will freeze over them.
3) Affected miners should freeze. They will stop moving and stop animating. 
Essentially, they are dead. They look like a miner except are a little bit more blue.
4) Elmo is the new entity that spawns. Elmo likes to eat miners, 
but only miners that are not full because he hates the taste of ore.
Elmo can move diagonally and side-to-side. 

Additional Information:
I am grateful that I refactored the code this quarter. I see how much easier 
it is now to add functionality to my code. The code is now so much easier to 
understand and modify. I am not really sure how I would add this functionality 
to the old code, but I'm sure it would be a nightmare.
