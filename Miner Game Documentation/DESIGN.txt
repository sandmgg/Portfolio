Entity:
+Random - is used in methods executeVeinActivity which I put in entity
+getAnimationPeriod - returns animationPeriod which is an instance variable in Entity
+nextImage - modifies titleIndex in entity object
+getCurrentTile - returns a tile from entity instance variable
+executeMinerFullActivity,
+executeMinerNotFullActivity,
+executeOreActivity,
+executeOreBlobActivity,
+executeQuakeActivity,
+executeVeinActivitity - they use the entity instance variables
-transformNotFull,
-transformFull,
-moveToNotFull,
-moveToFull - only applicable to a miner, which is an entity
-moveToOreBlob - deals with blob and oreblob, which are entities
-nextPositionMiner,
-nextPositionOreBlob - use many instance variables of entities
-nearestEntity,
-findNearest - can both be private if in Entity class, also nearestEntity 
		is called in findNearest, both uses instance variables 
		from entity class and return entities
+createBlacksmith,
+createMinerFull,
+createMinerNotFull,
+createObstacle,
+createOre,
+createOreBlob,
+createQuake,
+createVein - create different entities

Action:
+executeAction - has a switch statement with a variable from Action
-executeAnimationAction - uses variables from the Action class
-executeActivityAction - uses many variables from the Action class
+createAnimationAction,
+createActivityAction - create different kinds of actions

EventSchedule:
+scheduleActions - this method schedules a lot of events and use the
		 eventSchedule object from its parameter a lot

Point:
+adjacent - return whether two points are adjacent, only deals with points
+distanceSquared - parameters are points and deals with distance between two points

WorldModel:
+findOpenAround - calls withinBounds and is Occupioed 
		and returns point of open location on WorldModel
-withinBounds - checks whether point is in world and uses instance variable of WorldModel
+isOccupied - calls withinBounds and checks whether a point is occupied
+addEntity,
+moveEntity - uses methods and instance variables of WorldModel
+removeEntity - removes some entity from WorldModel class
-removeEntityAt - calls methods from WorldModel
+getOccupant - calls methods from WorldModel
-getOccupantCell, 
-setOccupantCell - has an instance varibable of world and is called 
		in other methods within WorldModel class
+paint - has instance variables from WorldModel class
